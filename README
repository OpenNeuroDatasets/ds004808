This dataset includes anatomical and functional images of 24 participants that have performed the local-global task.

 Functional images  are: 
* 4 runs partial-brain functional echo planar images (EPI) images centered on the brainstem
* 2 volumes with opposite phase encoding directions: anterior to posterior direction (AP) and the other direction (PA)

Anatomical images are: 
* 2 partial-brain Turbo Spin Echo (TSE)
* 1 whole-brain structural T1 image with an MPRAGE sequence 

Behavioural, physiological, and pupil data can be found on OSF at https://osf.io/td5kp/.
